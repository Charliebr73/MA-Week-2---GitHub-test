Question:

	Explain what git clone does, in your own words.

Answer:

	Cloning a git repo will make/download a local exact copy of the folder/files present in that repo. Special care shouls be taken as to avoid unnecessary nesting. 

	Also, there might be the risk of file/folder overwriting if there is already a folder with the same name as the repo being cloned.
